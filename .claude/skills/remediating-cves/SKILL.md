name: remediating-cves
description: Use when asked to remediate CVEs, security vulnerabilities, or GitHub code-scanning/Grype findings against a provider-upjet-harbor release — e.g. "fix the CVEs from grype", "patch the vulnerabilities on the latest release", a security alert on a release tag, or a request to cut a security patch release.

# Remediating CVEs

## Overview

`.github/workflows/grype-scan.yaml` runs weekly, scans the ghcr image of the
**latest GitHub release** with Grype, and uploads the SARIF results to GitHub
code scanning against `refs/tags/<that release's tag>`. Remediating a CVE
found this way means patching the released version's branch and shipping a
new patch release end to end: branch → fix → tag → release → publish → sign.
That release only gets cut once remediation is actually complete — see the
completeness gate in step 4.

## When to use

- Asked to remediate/fix CVEs, vulnerabilities, GHSA advisories, or grype /
  code-scanning findings tied to a release of this provider.
- **Not** for routine dependency bumps with no security alert behind them
  (that's ordinary `chore(deps)` / Renovate work), and not for a plain
  upstream Terraform-provider version bump with no CVE behind it.

## Procedure

### 1. Identify the target release branch

```bash
TAG=$(gh release view --json tagName -q .tagName)               # e.g. v1.0.1
BRANCH=release-$(echo "$TAG" | sed -E 's/^v([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\..*/\1.\2/')  # release-1.0
git fetch origin
git checkout "$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b "$BRANCH" "$TAG"
```

If `origin/$BRANCH` doesn't exist yet, it must be cut from the release **tag**,
never from `main` HEAD — a security patch must not carry unreleased changes.

### 2. Pull the CVE list from code scanning

Pass `ref` as an actual **query parameter**, not a client-side filter. The
list endpoint only returns alerts for the default branch unless `ref` is
given in the request itself — fetching all alerts and filtering afterward
with `select(.most_recent_instance.ref==...)` silently returns an empty
result even when open alerts exist for the tag:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts?ref=refs/tags/${TAG}&state=open" \
  --paginate \
  --jq ".[] | {number, rule: .rule.id, severity: .rule.security_severity_level, desc: .rule.description}"
```

For full detail (affected package, fixed-in version) on one alert:
`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts/{alert_number}`. Triage
critical/high first. Keep this full list handy — step 4 checks it against
what actually got fixed.

### 3. Remediate on the release branch

**Exception — never bump `github.com/goharbor/terraform-provider-harbor`
here.** If a CVE's only fix is a version bump of the wrapped Terraform
provider, do not touch its `go.mod` pseudo-version or the Makefile's
`TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_VERSION` as part of this flow. Leave that CVE
unremediated, keep going with everything else, and take it to the
completeness gate in step 4. Bumping the wrapped provider means regenerating
`config/schema.json` and every CRD against the new upstream schema, which
can shift resource shapes across the board — that's a deliberate, reviewed
change of its own, not something a security-patch branch should do as a
side effect.

Grype scans the built ghcr image, so only fix things that actually ship in
that image — the `terraform` CLI pinned by `TERRAFORM_VERSION` in the
Makefile is a build-time tool used only to generate `config/schema.json`; it
is never shipped, so a CVE against it is not something Grype would surface
from the release image and isn't a real finding to act on here.

Things that *do* ship, in order of likelihood:

- **Go module CVE** (any module other than the wrapped Terraform provider) →
  `go get <module>@<fixed-version> && go mod tidy`.
- **Go stdlib/toolchain CVE** → bump the `go` directive in `go.mod` (done
  before via the `cve-mitigation` branch's "Update Go to 1.26.4").
- **Base image CVE** (`gcr.io/distroless/static-debian13:nonroot` in
  `cluster/images/provider-upjet-harbor/Dockerfile`) → bump the pinned base
  image tag/digest.

Then `make reviewable` (generate + lint + test). Commit locally as
`fix(security): ...`, naming the CVE/GHSA IDs remediated (and, if any were
skipped under the exception above, note that in the commit body too). Do not
push yet — that's gated by step 4.

### 4. Completeness gate — halt here if remediation is partial

Compare what got fixed against the full CVE list from step 2.

- **Every open CVE was remediated** → show the user the diff and the CVE
  list addressed, confirm before pushing, then continue to step 5. From here
  on, everything is externally visible (pushed branch, public tag, GitHub
  release, published package) and isn't something you can quietly undo by
  editing further.
- **One or more CVEs were skipped under the terraform-provider-harbor
  exception in step 3** → **stop here.** Do not push, and do not trigger
  `Tag`, `Publish Provider Package`, or `Supply Chain and Xpkg Extensions` —
  none of steps 5–9 run. Leave the local commit(s) in place on `$BRANCH`,
  unpushed. Report:

  ```
  WARNING - provider update required!
  <CVE/GHSA ID> requires bumping terraform-provider-harbor to <fixed version>.
  Not applied by this flow — needs a dedicated bump of go.mod and
  Makefile's TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_VERSION together, followed by `make generate`
  and a full review of the resulting schema/CRD diff. Re-run CVE remediation
  afterward so the release covers every finding at once.
  ```

  One line (with its own remediation note) per skipped CVE if there's more
  than one. The point of halting before push is that cutting a release now
  just means cutting a second one right behind it once the provider bump
  lands — wait and ship one complete patch release instead.

### 5. Push

```bash
git push origin "$BRANCH"
```

### 6. Cut the patch tag — `Tag` workflow, from the release branch

```bash
NEW_VERSION=$(echo "$TAG" | awk -F. -v OFS=. '{$NF+=1} 1')   # v1.0.1 -> v1.0.2
gh workflow run Tag --ref "$BRANCH" -f version="$NEW_VERSION" \
  -f message="Security patch: <CVE/GHSA summary>"
```

### 7. Create the GitHub release

```bash
gh release create "$NEW_VERSION" --target "$BRANCH" \
  --title "$NEW_VERSION" \
  --notes "Security patch release. Remediates: <CVE/GHSA list>."
```

(`--target` only matters if the tag doesn't already exist; the `Tag` workflow
already created it, so this is just documentation-by-flag.)

### 8. Publish the package — `Publish Provider Package`, from the new tag

```bash
gh workflow run "Publish Provider Package" --ref "$NEW_VERSION" -f version="$NEW_VERSION"
```

Must run from the **tag**, not the branch — it builds the provider binary
(and regenerates the Terraform schema at build time) from that exact tagged
source.

### 9. Sign & attest — `Supply Chain and Xpkg Extensions`, from `main`

```bash
gh workflow run "Supply Chain and Xpkg Extensions" --ref main -f version="$NEW_VERSION"
```

Runs from `main`, not the tag — unlike step 8, this workflow doesn't build
anything from the ref it runs on. It signs/attests the image already
published to ghcr/xpkg.upbound.io by tag and appends Marketplace extensions
(SBOM, README, release notes), so it should use the newest signing logic on
`main` rather than whatever was frozen on the release branch at cut time.

### 10. Sequencing, verification, and reporting

Each of steps 6–9 must finish successfully before the next starts — step 8
needs the tag from step 6 to exist, step 9 needs the image step 8 published.
Find each run with `gh run list --workflow="<name>" --limit 1` and wait on it
(`gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status`); if using the Monitor tool, its
until-loop pattern is the sanctioned way to poll rather than a manual sleep
loop. Once all three conclude, optionally trigger `Grype Vulnerability Scan`
manually to confirm the new tag's image is clean, then report the CVE/GHSA
IDs remediated and the new version released.

## Quick reference

| Workflow | Ref to run from | Key inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `Tag` | release branch (`release-X.Y`) | `version`, `message` |
| (n/a) `gh release create` | — | tag name, `--target` branch |
| `Publish Provider Package` | the new tag (`vX.Y.Z+1`) | `version` |
| `Supply Chain and Xpkg Extensions` | `main` | `version` |

## Common mistakes

- Pushing or triggering any workflow when a CVE was skipped under the
  terraform-provider-harbor exception — the run must halt at step 4 instead.
  A partial security release just buys a second release right behind it
  once the provider bump lands; wait and ship one complete patch release.
- Bumping `terraform-provider-harbor` at all to close a CVE instead of
  flagging it — it's excluded from this flow on purpose (see step 3); a
  provider version bump needs its own reviewed change, not a rushed
  security-patch side effect.
- Cutting `release-X.Y` from `main` HEAD instead of the release tag — leaks
  unreleased changes into a security patch.
- If the terraform-provider-harbor exception is ever lifted for a one-off
  fix: bumping it in `go.mod` without also updating `Makefile`'s
  `TERRAFORM_PROVIDER_VERSION` (or vice versa) — the compiled binary and the
  generated CRD schema then describe two different provider versions; CI's
  `schema-version-diff`/`crddiff` checks exist specifically to catch this
  drift.
- "Fixing" a CVE reported against the pinned `terraform` CLI
  (`TERRAFORM_VERSION`) — it's a build-time-only tool never shipped in the
  release image, so Grype (which scans the release image) can't actually
  be the source of such a finding; double-check what surfaced it before
  spending time here.
- Running `Publish Provider Package` against the branch instead of the new
  tag — builds a moving target if the branch gets more commits later.
- Running `Supply Chain and Xpkg Extensions` from the tag instead of `main`
  — it still works, but forfeits any signing/attestation fixes landed on
  `main` since the release branch was cut.
- Triggering step 8 or 9 before the prior workflow run has actually finished
  — the tag or image it depends on won't exist yet.
- Fetching `code-scanning/alerts` with no `ref` query parameter and filtering
  by `most_recent_instance.ref` afterward — this returns an empty list even
  when the tag has real open alerts, reading as "no CVEs found" instead of
  a query bug. Always pass `ref=refs/tags/<tag>` in the request itself.
